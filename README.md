# hello-world
Crazyness
I'm on a mission ever since I became a reseller of godaddy. Funny thing is I had no idea how to even use wordpress. That was 3 months ago. I now have 8 websites from my self-schoolings on how to build a business with no income. I'm still learning but none of it is wasted. I'm dedicated to change the world somehow, someday. I know it sounds crazy, thats how confident I AM...I WILL
